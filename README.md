How can I use Mask.js?
----------------------

There are just a few steps:

1. You have to import mark.js into your project 
2. Once imported, just pass the next parameter with you desired configuration:

    ```
    var options = {
      $el: jQuery input,
      mask: pattern to apply(described in the next section),
      errorFunction: callback function triggered on every error,
      defaultValue: defaultValue to be shown on initialization(applies on date format),
      isUtc: if the pattern is a date format, utc will be considered
    }
    Mask.newMask(options);
    ```
3. Pattern is the mask you want to apply over the input. It can be one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Any combination of YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm, where:
<ul>
    <li>
        Y means year
    </li>
    <li>
        M means month
    </li>
    <li>
        D means day
    </li>
    <li>
        H means hour
    </li>
    <li>
        m means minutes
    </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>n for typing only numbers</li>
<li>az for typing only characters</li>
</ul>
